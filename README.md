# AlterUI

Lightweight Kotlin/Java UI framework.

The main task is to make window creation faster and easier.

## Why AlterUI?
- **JavaFX** uses A LOT of reflection. Therefore, applications may not run as fast as they should. CSS is not CSS. The API is also very obscure in places.

- **Swing** is very old and heavyweight. Creating an UI using this framework is literally a pain. Also on Windows the window resizes horribly and has a lot of issues on HiDPI monitors.

- **SWT** uses native widgets.

- **AWT**? No.

> AlterUI is very young, so it does not pretend to replace the frameworks above.
